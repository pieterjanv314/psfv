Thank you for your interest in my PSF-based light curve extraction code with TESS data tailored for asteroseismic studies. 

Please find full documentation in docs/build/html/index.html
    
There is a paper in preparation (expected to be submitted late 2025) that will illustrate the scientific relevance of this method as well as describe the technical details. 

This code is still being tested, so bugs may be present

For any queries or feedback, please email p.van-daele2@newcastle.ac.uk


Installation instructions

1) in terminal, activate a new or your favorite conda env
2) change directory into this folder, i.e. the folder with the pyproject.toml file
3) run "python -m pip install -e ."
4) try running the tutorial. I recommend moving the tutorial notebook to another location since more folders and files will be created when using this package and perhaps it is best if this stays separate from the original source code.
