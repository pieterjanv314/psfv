Thank you for your interest in my PSF-based light curve extraction code with TESS data tailored for asteroseismic studies. 
Please find documentation in psfv/docs/build/html/index.html
    
There is a paper in preperation (expected to be submitted late 2025) that will illustrate the scientific relevance of this method as well as describe the technical details. 

This code is still being tested, so bugs may be present. I intend to make a tutorial script on how to use this code in the future.

For any queries or feedback, please email p.van-daele2@newcastle.ac.uk
