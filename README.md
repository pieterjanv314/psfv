Thank you for your interest in my PSF-based light curve extraction code with TESS data tailored for asteroseismic studies. 

There is a paper in preperation (expected to be published late summer 2025) that will illustrate the scientific potential of this methods as well as describe the technical details. 

This code is till being tested, so bugs may be present. I intend to make a tutorial script on how to use this code in the future.

For any queries, email p.van-daele2@newcastle.ac.uk
